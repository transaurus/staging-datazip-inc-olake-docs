They operate at two different architectural layers to solve two completely different problems.\n\nLet\'s make this concrete. Think of your data lake as a massive digital music library.\n\nParquet files are the individual MP3 files. Each one is a perfectly encoded, high-fidelity container for the actual music—your data. It is the raw asset.\n\nIceberg is the playlist. The playlist file itself contains no music. It is a simple metadata file that points to the specific MP3s that constitute your "Workout Mix". It provides the logical grouping, the name, and the order.\n\nYou can add or remove a song from the playlist (a transaction) or see what the playlist looked like last week (time travel) without ever altering the underlying MP3 files. Iceberg is the management layer; Parquet is the storage layer.'

              text: 'All three are open table formats designed to solve similar problems (ACID transactions, schema evolution, time travel). The primary differences lie in their design philosophy and underlying implementation.\n\nApache Iceberg: Prioritizes a universal, open specification with zero engine dependencies. Its greatest strengths are fast query planning at massive scale (via its manifest file indexes) and guaranteed interoperability. It is architected to avoid the "list-then-filter" problem that can plague other formats on petabyte-scale tables, making it a robust choice for multi-engine, large-scale data lakehouses.\n\nDelta Lake: Originated at Databricks and is deeply integrated with the Apache Spark ecosystem. It uses a chronological JSON transaction log (_delta_log) to track table state. It is often considered the most straightforward to adopt if your organization is already standardized on Databricks and Spark.\n\nApache Hudi: Originated at Uber with a strong focus on low-latency streaming ingest and incremental processing. It offers more granular control over the trade-off between write performance and read performance through its explicit Copy-on-Write and Merge-on-Read storage types.\n\nThe choice is one of architectural trade-offs. Iceberg is built for interoperability and scale, Delta for deep integration with Spark, and Hudi for fine-grained control over streaming workloads.'

              text: 'On the contrary, for any non-trivial table, Iceberg provides a significant performance improvement.\n\nThe perceived "overhead" is the storage of a few extra kilobytes of metadata files. The problem it solves is the primary performance bottleneck in cloud data lakes: recursively listing the millions of files that make up a large table. This LIST operation is notoriously slow and expensive.\n\nIceberg avoids this entirely by using its manifest files as a pre-built index of the table\'s data files. The query engine reads this small index to find the exact files it needs to scan, transforming a slow file-system operation into a fast metadata lookup. It trades a negligible amount of storage for a massive gain in query planning speed.'

              '@type': 'Answer',
              text: 'It\'s critical to remember that Parquet files are immutable. Iceberg never changes an existing Parquet file. Instead, it handles deletes using a metadata-driven, merge-on-read approach.\n\nWhen a DELETE command is issued, Iceberg creates lightweight delete files. These files store the path to a data file and the specific row positions within that file that are marked for deletion. At query time, the engine reads both the original Parquet data file and its associated delete file, merging them on the fly to present a view of the data where the deleted rows are filtered out.\n\nThink of it as an errata slip published for a book. The original book text is not altered, but the slip tells the reader to ignore a specific sentence on a specific page. The process of making this deletion permanent by rewriting the data files is handled by a separate, asynchronous compaction job.'

Kafka Connect is a framework that simplifies the integration of Apache Kafka with other data systems. By using Kafka Connect, Debezium can capture changes from databases and stream them into Kafka topics without requiring custom code.\n\nExample:\n\nDebezium Connector: Acts as a bridge between your MongoDB database and Kafka.\n\nKafka Connect Framework: Manages the connector, handling tasks like starting, stopping, and scaling the Debezium connector as needed.'
